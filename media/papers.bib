   abstract = {Downscaled paleoclimate datasets are widely used in biogeographical research, aiding our understanding of past environmental shifts and species’ responses to climate change. Numerous datasets exist, varying in spatiotemporal resolution and underlying methodologies, resulting in variation in estimated temperature. Understanding this variability is important for accurately reconstructing past biogeographical dynamics, especially in complex regions like mountains. We compare the Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) from five different downscaled paleoclimate datasets — Beyer, CHELSA-TraCE21k, EcoClimate, PALEO-PGEM-series, WorldClim — against MAT estimates from paleoenvironmental proxy records (fossil pollen and plant macrofossils) within and outside mountains. Additionally, we test the performance of a ‘global grid cooling’ method (i.e. lowering local temperatures by a global LGM estimate) against proxy records. Then, we evaluate the implications of inter-dataset variability for reconstructing temperature-delimited biomes in mountains by reconstructing LGM treeline elevations. We find that LGM temperature cooling and treeline reconstructions strongly vary amongst paleoclimate datasets and between datasets and proxy records. The temperature gradient with elevation is poorly captured by datasets with a coarser spatial resolution. Paleoclimate datasets generally suggest a warmer LGM than proxy records, especially in mountains, while the global grid cooling method more closely aligns with proxy records. Inter-dataset variability can strongly affect the outcome of temperature-delimited reconstructions of biomes and their boundaries, such as treelines. We call for greater awareness and more transparency about the limitations of downscaled paleoclimate datasets in mountainous areas and suggest further research to be aimed at capturing the small-scale heterogeneity of mountains in paleotemperature datasets.</p>},

   abstract = {The barnacle Austrominius modestus, native of New Zealand and Australia was introduced to the South of England around 1943 and has since spread to most coastal waters in Western Europe, including the southern North Sea. Apart from an ephemeral incursion into the Danish Wadden Sea in 1978, since 2010 it has established permanent populations capable of reproduction along the North Sea coast of the Jutland peninsula, the Limfjord, the north-western Kattegat, and the Skagerrak. It has probably invaded Danish waters by pelagic larvae originating in the German Wadden Sea. The species has since spread to other Danish localities, likely following the prevailing currents, but other means, as for instance transport by vessels, are possible. The barnacle inhabits stones, stone-reefs, mollusk shells, and live shore crabs in shallow waters. Based on hydrographical data from its native and recently invaded areas, we predict its future distribution to extend to most coasts of continental Europe except for brackish waters (<20 PSU), and the Arctic seas. The northernmost distribution limit may include the Lofoten Islands of Norway.},

   abstract = {Climate warming has triggered shifts in plant distributions, resulting in changes within communities, characterized by an increase in warm‐demanding species and a decrease in cold‐adapted species – referred to as thermophilization. Researchers conventionally rely on co‐occurrence data from vegetation assemblages to examine these community dynamics. Despite the increasing availability of presence‐only data in recent decades, their potential has largely remained unexplored due to concerns about their reliability. Our study aimed to determine whether climate‐induced changes in community dynamics, as inferred from presence‐only data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), corresponded with those derived from co‐occurrence plot data. To assess the differences between these datasets, we computed a community temperature index (CTI) using a transfer function, weighted‐averaging partial least squares regression (WA‐PLS). We calibrated the transfect function model based on the species–temperature relationship using data before recent climate warming. Then we assessed the differences in CTI and examined the temporal trend in thermophilization. In a preliminary analysis, we assessed the performance of this calibration using three datasets: 1) Norwegian co‐occurrence data, 2) presence‐only data from a broader European region organized into pseudo‐plots (potentially capturing a larger part of the species niches), and 3) a combined dataset merging 1) and 2). The transfer function including the combined dataset performed best. Subsequently, we compared the CTI for the co‐occurrence plots paired up spatially and temporally with presence‐only pseudo‐plots. The results demonstrated that presence‐only data can effectively evaluate species assemblage responses to climate warming, with consistent CTI and thermophilization values to what was found for the co‐occurrence data. Employing presence‐only data for evaluating community responses opens up better spatial and temporal resolution and much more detailed analyses of such responses. Our results therefore outline how a large amount of presence‐only data can be used to enhance our understanding of community dynamics in a warmer world.</p>},

abstract = {Abstract Belowground niche partitioning presents a key mechanism for maintaining species coexistence and diversity. Its importance is currently reinforced by climate change that alters soil hydrological conditions. However, experimental tests examining the magnitude of its change under climate change are scarce. We combined measurements of oxygen stable isotopes to infer plant water-uptake depths and extreme drought manipulation in grasslands. Belowground niche partitioning was evidenced by different water-uptake depths of co-occurring species under ambient and extreme drought conditions despite an increased overlap among species due to a shift to shallower soil layers under drought. A co-occurrence of contrasting strategies related to the change of species water-uptake depth distribution was likely to be key for species to maintain some extent of belowground niche partitioning and could contribute to stabilizing coexistence under drought. Our results suggest that belowground niche partitioning could mitigate negative effects on diversity imposed by extreme drought under future climate.},

   abstract = {What would you do if temperatures were getting really warm where you live? You might put on some lighter clothes or maybe even move to a cooler place. Many plants do something similar—they “move” to cooler areas to survive current climate warming. Of course, plants cannot move like animals do, but they can slowly change locations as they release their seeds. How do we know that plants are moving? Scientists are studying areas that were first described hundreds of years ago. However, ecologists have found that even though plants respond to warming by changing locations, the temperature increase is so fast that plants cannot always move fast enough to escape the warming climate. This means that some plants might end up living under much warmer conditions than they prefer, which causes them a lot of stress. Stress makes plants vulnerable to other human influences, like land use change or invasive species, which can put entire plant species in danger.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim Current global warming is driving changes in biological assemblages by increasing the number of thermophilic species while reducing the number of cold-adapted species, leading to thermophilization of these assemblages. However, there is increasing evidence that thermophilization might not keep pace with global warming, resulting in thermal lags. Here, we quantify the magnitude of thermal lags of plant assemblages in Norway during the last century and assess how their spatio-temporal variation is related to variables associated with temperature-change velocity, topographic heterogeneity, and habitat type. Location Norway. Time period 1905–2007. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We inferred floristic temperature from 16,351 plant assemblages and calculated the floristic temperature anomaly (difference between floristic temperature and baseline temperature) and thermal lag index (difference between reconstructed floristic temperature and observed climatic temperature) from 1905 until 2007. Using generalized least squares models, we analysed how the variation in observed lags since 1980 is related to temperature-change velocity (measured as magnitude, rate of temperature change, and distance to past analogous thermal conditions), topographic heterogeneity, and habitat type (forest versus non-forest), after accounting for the baseline temperature. Results The floristic temperature anomaly increases overall during the study period. However, thermophilization falls behind temperature change, causing a constantly increasing lag for the same period. The thermal lag index increases most strongly in the period after 1980, when it is best explained by variables related to temperature-change velocity. We also find a higher lag in non-forested areas, while no relationship is detected between the degree of thermal lag and fine-scale topographic heterogeneity. Main conclusions The thermal lag of plant assemblages has increased as global warming outpaces thermophilization responses. The current lag is associated with different dimensions of temperature-change velocity at a broad landscape scale, suggesting specifically that limited migration is an important contributor to the observed lags.},
